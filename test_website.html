	<h2>What is Physical Organic Chemistry?</h2>
	<div class="article1">
	<p>Physical organic chemistry is a branch of organic chemistry that focuses less on synthesis in a laboratory and more on how the reactions take place and probing potential mechanisms. It applies the experimental nature of physical chemistry to the analysis of organic molecules. It tends to focus more on examining the reactivity of molecules and theorizing about transition states than actual wet chemistry synthesis.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article2">
	<p>My interest lies specifically in the computational side of the field, which focuses more on examining reactions and energy changes through simulations and molecular modeling using both Spartan and Gaussian software packages. When I do start my graduate research, I would like to go in the direction of using quantum mechanical calculations to study reactions and mechanisms.</p>

	<p>One of my formal lab rotations has focused on studying radical chemistry. It has consisted of using Gaussian software to examine the energy changes between ethylene (right) and acetylene interacting with three different radicals.The table below shows the results in kcal/mol.</p>
